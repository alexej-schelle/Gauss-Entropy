# Information-Loss-in-Gaussian-Spectral-Data

This repository contains a summary of a Python method to determine the loss of information from dimensionality reduction in Gaussian-distributed 
spectral data, as described in Whitepaper_Information_Gauss.pdf. 

In order to estimate the relative loss of information, the Shannon entropy is used in this primary study (@hema.to GmbH) on information loss from dimensionality reduction as a quantitative measure in order to calculate the deviations of the total entropy to the sum of entropies in an ensemble 
of particles emitting five different frequency components.  

In collaboration with hema.to GmbH in Ainmiller. 22, Munich, I am currently searching for people interested in a common freelancer project, 
bachelor- or master thesis (e. g. at the IU International University of Applied Sciences).

For applications and proposals, or interests in the Python source code of the corresponding Gaussian Information Model, please contact :

    Dr. A. Schelle, Freelancer Lecturer @ IU International University of Applied Sciences (E-Mail: alexej.schelle.ext@iu.org), 
    
    or
    
    Dr. Hannes LÃ¼ling, CEO @ hema.to GmbH, Ainmiller Str. 22, 80801 Munich (E-Mail: hannes@hema.to).
