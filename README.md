# Information-Loss-in-Gaussian-Spectral-Data

This repository contains a Python method to determine the loss of information from dimensionality reduction in Gaussian-distributed spectral data. 

To estiamte the relative loss of information, the Shannon entropy is used as a measure in order to calculate the deviations of the total entropy to the sum of entropies in an ensemble of particle with five different frequnency components.
