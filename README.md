# QMCM-Data-Science

This repository contains a quantum Monte-Carlo methods software for applied data sciences, called QMCM Data Science, 
developed in the framework of project and scientific works on quantitative and didactic data science models.

The software package includes Monte-Carlo routines for the following scientific applications:

1. ) Bose-Einstein condensation 
    
    - Quantum Fields at Thermal Equilibrium
    - Phase Distributions of Real Valued Fields Modes
    - Coherence Times and Distributions of Quantum Field Correlations 
    - Chemical Potential and Distributions of the Quantum Field
    - Superimposed Quantum Fields

2. ) Spectral Data Analysis

    - Shannon Entropy of Gaussian Spectral Data
    - 

3. ) Number Theory and Applications

    - Prime Number Calculation
