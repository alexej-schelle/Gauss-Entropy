# QMCM-Data-Science

This repository is a dynamic repository for quantum Monte-Carlo methods software development for Applied Data Sciences, called QMCM Data Science, 
developed in the framework of project and scientific works on quantitative and didactic data science models.

The software package includes Monte-Carlo routines for the following scientific applications:

1. ) Quantum mechanics
  
    - Bose-Einstein condensation
    - Einstein's Quantum Clock

2. ) Spectral Data Analysis

    - Shannon Entropy of Gaussian Spectral Data
    - Monte-Carlo Price Spectrum
    
3. ) Number Theory and Applications

    - Prime Number Calculation
