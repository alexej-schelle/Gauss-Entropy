# QMCM-Data-Science

This repository is a dynamic repository for the development of a quantum Monte-Carlo methods software application in the framework
of scientific work performed in the context of projects and scientific modelling on quantitative and didactic data science models.

The software package includes Monte-Carlo routines for the following scientific applications:

1. ) Quantum mechanics
  
    - Bose-Einstein condensation
    - Einstein's Quantum Clock

2. ) Spectral Data Analysis

    - Shannon Entropy of Gaussian Spectral Data
    - Monte-Carlo Price Spectrum
    
3. ) Number Theory and Applications

    - Prime Number Calculation
