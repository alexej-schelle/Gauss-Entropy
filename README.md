# Information-Loss-in-Gaussian-Spectral-Data

This repository contains a summary of a Python method to determine the loss of information from dimensionality reduction in Gaussian-distributed 
spectral data, as described in Whitepaper_hemato_09122022.pdf. 

In order to estimate the relative loss of information, the Shannon entropy is used in this primary study (@hema.to GmbH) on information loss from dimensionality reduction as a quantitative measure in order to calculate the deviations of the total entropy to the sum of entropies in an ensemble 
of particles emitting five different frequency components.  

If you are interested in the Python source code of the corresponding Gaussian information model, please contact :

    Dr. A. Schelle, Freelancer Lecturer @ IU International University of Applied Sciences (E-Mail: alexej.schelle.ext@iu.org), or        
    Dr. Hannes LÃ¼ling, CEO @ hema.to GmbH, Ainmiller Str. 22, 80801 Munich (E-Mail: hannes@hema.to).

Currently, I am also interested in extending the analysis to the general case of non-Gaussian random spectral data in 
arbitrary dimensions from N = 2 to N = 10. For collaborations, please contact alexej.schelle.ext@iu.org.

With best regards,

Alexej.
