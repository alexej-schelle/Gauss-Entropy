# Information-Loss-in-Gaussian-Spectral-Data

This repository contains a summary of a Python method to determine the loss of information from dimensionality reduction in Gaussian-distributed 
spectral data, as described in the whitepaper Whitepaper_Information_Gauss.pdf. 

In order to estimate the relative loss of information, the Shannon entropy is used in this primary study (@hema.to GmbH) on information loss from dimensionality reduction as a quantitative measure in order to calculate the deviations of the total entropy to the sum of entropies in an ensemble 
of particles emitting five different frequency components.  

# In collaboration with hema.to GmbH in Ainmiller. 22, Munich, were are currently searching for people interested in a common freelancer project, 
bachelor- or master thesis (e. g. at the IU International University of Applied Sciences).

For applications and proposals, or interested in the Python source code of the Gaussian Information Model, please contact :
